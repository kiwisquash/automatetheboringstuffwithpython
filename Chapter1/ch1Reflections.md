# Reflections

Some interesting new tidbits (I knew, but I don't think of):

- IDLE stands for "Interactive Development Environment"
- idle3 is the command for running the python3 IDLE
- python comes from Monty Python, which means I need to watch more Monty Python

Good to remember:

- pastebin
- gist.github.com
- programming sub-reddit
- stackoverflow
- inventwithpython website has free stuff online
    - why did you buy this book, yo?
