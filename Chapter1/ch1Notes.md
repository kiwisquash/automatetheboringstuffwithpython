- *Expressions*: part of the program consisting of *values* and *operators*.
- *values*: I am not sure if there is a rigorous definition?
- *operators*: stuff that does things with values.
- *evaluate*: to evaluate means to turn an expression into a single value
- Order of operations is the same as the math one.
    - \*\* has the highest *precedence*. 
- *data type*: Category of values
    - for now, just think of *int*, *float*, and *string*
- *string replicatoin*: replicate a string. (e.g., 5\*'Bob')
- "=" is the *assignment operator*, and *x = 1* is an example of an *assignment statement*. 
- a variable is *initialized* the first time a value gets stored into it.
- *overwriting* is when you assign a new value to a variable.
- Use \# comment in python
    - *commenting out* is when you place a something in a comment.
- Python will *call* a function when it executes a line of function that includes a function.
- A value gets *passed* to the function.
- Value that is *passed* to a function is called an *argument*.

# Variable names

This is something I never think about, but I should probably know this.

1. Variable name must be one word. (No spaces!)
2. Letters, numbers, underscores only.
3. Cannot begin with a number.
