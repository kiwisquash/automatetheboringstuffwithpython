- Define functions using "def"
- parameter is the variable that an argument is stored in
    - parameters have local scope
- "A functional call evaluates to its return value"
- A function without return value evaluates to the None value.
    - NoneType data it is the only one
- Nothing having a return statement is the same as having `return None`
- print has keyword arguments
    - print(string1, string2, ..., sep = separator, end = finishingSring)
- variables inside of a function have a local scope.
- there is only one global scope
- use the global keyword inside of the function to give the variable global scope.
- use 'try' and 'except' to handle errorws
    - why? otherwise, the entire program will terminate.
