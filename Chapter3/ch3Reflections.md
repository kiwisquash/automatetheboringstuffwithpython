# Reflections

Again, mostly stuff I already knew.

## New bits:
- flow chart conventions.
- continue in loops.
- sys.exit(), random().randint()  # I probably just forgot about it.

## Reminded bits:
- booleans are capitalized in Python
- boolean operators are lowercase in Python 
- `!python3 %` is your friend
