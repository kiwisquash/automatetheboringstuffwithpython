Chapter 1 - 6

## Part 2: Automating tasks

Sprint duration: TBD

# Tools of the trade

I have been using vim for a while, so vim will be the text editor of my choice.

Currently, I don't have that many plug-ins. I don't need them for the kinds of small projects I will be working on, I think, though that may change as things go on.

## Running python straight from vim

`:!python3 %` will call python3 and pass the current file.
