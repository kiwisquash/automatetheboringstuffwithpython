# Reflections

Again, mostly stuff I already knew.

Good to brush up on some terminology.
- *expression* is made up of *values* and *operators* that *evaluates* to a single value with no operators, if there are no errors, that is.
- the program *calls* functions, and the values that *passed* to the function are called *arguments*.

Variable names in python: three rules:
1. One word (I knew that)
2. Letters and numbers and underscores only (I did not know that)
    - This is how I normally define variables, but I did not know that you cannot define variables using other symbols
3. Can't start with a number.
    - I never would, but I didn't know this was banned.
