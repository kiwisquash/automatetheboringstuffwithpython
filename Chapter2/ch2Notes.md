# Flowchart basics

- rounded rectangle: start / end
- diamond: branching points
- rectangle: other steps

# Boolean

Use the following capitalizations in python.
- True 
- False

Note: int and float values: 42 == 42.0 is True.
- unlike javascript, there is no ===.

## Truthy and Falsey
- Non-boolean values that are treated as such
- 0, 0.0, "" are Falsey.

## Boolean operators are lowercase.
- not, and, or (order of precedence)

# Vocab
- condition: boolean expression
- clause: block of code following a condition
- execution: current instruction (line) in code that is being done

# Conditionals
- if
- elif
- else

# Loops
- while
- for
    - range() function.

## Loop commands
- break: leave the loop
- continue: go back to the top of the loop (new for me!)

# Importing modules

import \<thing\>
import \<thing1\>,\<thing2\>,...
from \<thing\> import \<function\>

## Examples 
- random().randint()
- sys.exit()
